# Algorithmic Challenges and Experience at Alem School

During my studies at Alem School, I actively participated in solving algorithmic problems, which significantly deepened my understanding of programming and algorithmic thinking. Here are some examples of the algorithms I studied and implemented:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**:  
   I explored and implemented various sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort. These algorithms are fundamental for efficiently ordering arrays of data, which is essential for many other algorithmic solutions.

2. **Searching Algorithms**:  
   I implemented searching algorithms, including linear search and binary search. These methods enable efficient element retrieval from arrays with varying complexities, which is crucial when dealing with large datasets.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:  
   I studied dynamic programming techniques by solving problems like the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem. These techniques help optimize the solution to complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

4. **Graphs and Trees**:  
   I learned about graph and tree data structures, as well as algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms are used to navigate networks and other interconnected data.

5. **Combinatorics**:  
   I tackled problems related to combinatorics, such as counting different combinations and permutations, which helps develop analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

I solved around 200 problems of various difficulty levels on the LeetCode platform and participated in algorithm competitions, often placing in the top ranks. These efforts strengthened my programming skills and built my confidence in tackling complex challenges.
